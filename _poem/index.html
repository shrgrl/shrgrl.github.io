<p>Hello everyone. I want to talk about “Poems” today. Especially my favorite poems. Actually I think when we read a poem, if we want to feel poem’s message, we have to know 
poems’s language. Because every language has different properties. Therefore, when we read a poem and if we don’t know this poem’s language that writing, probably we won’t 
understant clearly. If I give you an example, there is a poem that my favorite. When I read it I feel so emotional. But when I translate it lost meaning. Therefor, I thougt 
about it and I decided explain my favorite poem. Maybe everyone can even a little understand. Let’s explain step by step!

<h6><b>GERİ GELEN MEKTUP BY HÜSEYİN NİHAL ATSIZ</b></h6>
<p>
Ey sen ki kül ettin beni onmaz yakışınla, <br>
Ey sen ki gönüller tutuşur her bakışınla! <br>
Hançer gibi keskin ve çiçekler gibi ince <br>
Çehren bana uğrunda ölüm hazzı verince <br>
Gönlümdeki azgın devi rüzgarlara attım; <br>
Gözlerle günah işlemenin zevkini tattım. <br>
Gözler ki birer parçasıdır sende İlahın, <br>
Gözler ki senin en katı zulmün ve silahın, <br>
Vur şanlı silahınla gönül mülkü düzelsin; <br>
Sen öldürüyorken de vururken de güzelsin!
</p>

<p>
<b>Ey sen ki kül ettin beni onmaz yakışınla, :</b>“Ey” mean is word of call in this. Writer here say to his love; you have a fire and your fire burning always. And I was burned in your fire and turned to ashes. <br>
<b>Ey sen ki gönüller tutuşur her bakışınla! :</b>Writer say, when you ever look at me I ignite because it’s you have a fire. <br>
<b>Hançer gibi keskin ve çiçekler gibi ince  :</b>Here writer, likens her lover's face to a sharp dagger and a graceful, thin flower. <br>
<b>Çehren bana uğrunda ölüm hazzı verince    :</b>Here, writer tells that even death is pleasurable when she looks at her lover's face. <br>
<b>Gönlümdeki azgın devi rüzgarlara attım;   :</b>He saying, there is a giant living in my heart and I left it to winds. <br>
<b>Gözlerle günah işlemenin zevkini tattım.  :</b>I sin with my eyes while watching you, but it still gives me pleasure. <br>
<b>Gözler ki birer parçasıdır sende İlahın,  :</b>Here writer, thinks that her lover's eyes are a part of God. <br>
<b>Gözler ki senin en katı zulmün ve silahın,:</b>And he think, her eyes are the most powerful weapon to persecute him. <br>
<b>Vur şanlı silahınla gönül mülkü düzelsin; :</b>He say to her; shoot me with your beautiful gun so that my heart will be healed. <br>
<b>Sen öldürüyorken de vururken de güzelsin! :</b>And you are beautiful when you kill and when you shoot!
</p>

I should say, best part that in this poem is last part. You can say a lot with a single word in Turkish. Or you can describe a situation with many different words. And when we translate a lot of word, they lost real meaing. But still I tried to explain. Poems are beautiful things. I think if someone has a real heart, they can enjoy poems. We have a sentence in Turkish and I agree with it: “Beautiful people either have poems or türkü(traditional song).”

And this one is my first trying in English;
</p>

<h6><b>GAME OVER BY SEHER GÜREL</b></h6>
<p>
If you listen to silence of night, <br>
You will want to rip the sun out. <br>
And when you close your eyes <br>
Your tears will clean your insides. <br>
Now open your eyes and feel, you good player <br>
Now you can bury yourself because it's game over.
