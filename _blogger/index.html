<h4>Hello everyone, friends.</h4>
<p>First of all, I want to mention that I'm quite excited to write my first blog post. In this first article I'm publishing, I'll talk about my career adventure,
student life, graduation, responsibilities, job search process, and my experiences in many other topics. I hope it will be informative 
and enjoyable for you.</p>
<h3>How Did I Start?</h3>
<p>My journey began when I was placed in the Computer Engineering department at Atatürk University. First, let me talk about what it's like to be a 
student in Erzurum. Erzurum is a city that I would consider quite developed. Although it's not very suitable for summer tourism, I can say it's 
quite ideal for cold lovers like me. Social life is not as dynamic as in other big cities. However, considering that it's a place with few crowds, 
peaceful and comfortable, it's very suitable if you want to be a school-focused student. When I first started school, I couldn't say I was a very 
brilliant student due to the stress and adaptation difficulties of living in a different city for the first time. In fact, I can't forget the 
disappointment and fear I experienced when I first attended classes. It felt like we were speaking different languages with the professors, and 
like everyone else, the feeling of "Am I the only one who doesn't understand?" made me very anxious. I didn't want to go to school. I was neither 
studying nor fulfilling my responsibilities. But of course, these things never require a person to fall into despair. You can consider that I 
returned from the brink of failing a grade and am now an engineer receiving job offers. Especially in my last two years, I made this possible by 
focusing only on my goals and working dedicatedly. I neither compromised my social life nor my student life. I managed time control on how to 
be productive from every moment. I realized the mistakes I made in due time, and as I said, it's never too late to change things. 
Of course, it's more possible to achieve all this by acting with the right people, even if not alone. Stay away from negative energy and bring 
people into your life who will give you positive energy, be a source of motivation, and believe that you can constantly move forward. Fortunately, 
I met the right people and my motivation and self-confidence always stayed alive 😊.</p>
<h3>What Should We Do?</h3>
<p>Years passed quickly and I graduated with what could be considered an ideal average. But let me also mention this: when applying for jobs, no one 
cares what average you graduated with. The real issue is how much you can develop yourself and how much you can show it. 
First, question what areas give you pleasure. Of course, we may not only do jobs we love in the business world, but if we develop ourselves in the 
field we want, employers will also evaluate us in the direction we have developed. Never put aside what you learned at school, your assignments, 
your projects. They will all find a place in your resume as experiences. Also, uploading all your projects to your <a href="https://github.com/shrgrl" target="_blank">Github</a> account in an organized 
way will provide convenience for people to examine and will be an indicator of you being a more organized person. 
With these thoughts, I first decided to create a platform where I could clearly express myself and created my own website, 
developed different projects. I read, researched, and I'm still continuing. If you're entering this profession, the first rule for me is to be enthusiastic. 
If you do your job with enthusiasm and love, patience, dedication and desire follow. For a person who has all these, success becomes an inevitable 
end.<br><br>
The foundation language of programming languages is English. And unfortunately, the education we received in public high school is not sufficient to deal with these. 
It's very difficult to find an error you encounter in a program from Turkish sources. It's very important to improve your English and do your research 
from the right sources. I'm also in the process of improving my language these days. I'm constantly working and trying to practice, and I believe that 
I'll be able to work without needing Google Translate soon😊.</p>
<h3>Conclusion...</h3>
<p>In short, for those who know how to work, are enthusiastic, and love this job, Computer Engineering is one of the most enjoyable jobs in the world. Don't be afraid, don't 
give up, work hard and you'll see that you're satisfied with the results.<br><br>
In my first article, I wanted to talk about myself and give small pieces of advice. I hope you like it. Thank you for taking the time, see you in my 
next article…</p><br>
