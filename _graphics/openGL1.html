<p>
  Hello everyone. This application shows a simple tree drawing using the Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm. You can follow my Github account for the project's source codes:

<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">Technologies Used</h5>
<ul>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>OpenGL</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">OpenGL</h5>
<p>OpenGL is a free graphics application development interface used for drawing both two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics on screen using advanced hardware support. It is widely supported on many operating systems such as Windows, Linux, MacOS and Solaris.</p>

<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">Bresenham Algorithm</h5>
<p>It is a line drawing algorithm developed by American computer engineer Jack Bresenham in the 1960s for IBM for drawing lines on computer screens. It can be used in two or three-dimensional environments. According to this, the coordinates of the starting and ending points determine what path to follow to draw a specific line and is used in calculating the pixels through which this line passes.</p>

<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">Running the Project</h5>
<p>To run the project, we need to acquire Visual Studio as the environment. Then there are <i>GLU/GLUT</i> libraries that we need to download and add externally. You can access them 
  from this link. After downloading the file, first we need to copy and paste the <b>.dll</b> extension files in the file to the folder in the <i>C:\Windows\System32</i> file path.</p>
<p>Then, after starting the project with Visual Studio, we right-click on the project in the section on the right side and enter the <b>Properties</b> section.</p>

<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/bresenham/img.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>On the screen that appears here, we go to the <b>Additional Include Directories</b> option in the <b>General</b> section of the C/C++ option and add the <b>include</b> files separately from within the file directory we downloaded.</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/bresenham/img1.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/bresenham/img1.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>Secondly, we go to the <b>Additional Library Directories</b> option in the <b>Linker</b> section and add the <i>lib</i> files separately from within the file directory we downloaded.</p>

<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/bresenham/img2.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>After all the addition operations, we can run our project. After pressing the <b>Run</b> button, such an image will appear in the interface that appears.</p>
