<p>Hello everyone. Today I'm going to show you some information about SAP and its subsections. Every SAP consultant/developer should know these basics. Let’s start!</p>

<ul><p><b>1. SAP as a company/business:</b></p> 
  <li>Historically, it was established in 1972(one thousand nine hundred seventy-two) in Germany by 5 people from IBM.</li>
  <li>It was originally called System Analysis Program Development, but was later shortened to SAP.</li>
  <li>Technically, SAP is a system that facilitates the management of business processes of companies.</li>
  <li>It is basically a program used in the field of ERP.</li>
</ul>

<ul><p><b>2. ERP</b></p>
  <li>ERP, which means Enterprise Resource Planning, can be defined as the general name given to systems that gather all the structure needed by an institution such as planning, production, operation... into a single body.</li>
  <li>The most known and widespread program in the ERP world is SAP.</li>
  <li>It is divided into modules to meet all needs. I can give examples such as <i>SD(Sale and Distribution)</i> module responsible for sales and distribution of companies and <i>PP(Production Planning)</i> module responsible for production and planning. We can reproduce it as ;</li>
  <sub><li>Financial Accounting (FI)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Controlling (CO)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Materials Management (MM)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Logistics Execution (LE)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Quality Management (QM)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Plant Maintenance (PM)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Project System (PS)</li></sub>
  <sub><li>Human Resources (HR)</li></sub>
</ul>

<ul><p><b>3. ABAP and FIORI</b></p>
  <li>ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) is an object-oriented, high-level software language developed by SAP for the development of SAP software. </li>
  <li>With ABAP, the desired information is read from the database, and user interfaces that enable data exchange between SAP systems and fields required for adding records to the system can be written and reported.</li>
  <li>FIORI is an ABAP is the user interface that enables screen outputs to be used more conveniently, easily and on different platforms. </li>
  <li>It is developed with UI5 technology, which is a combination of User Interface and HTML5.</li>
</ul>

<ul><p><b>4. The role of an SAP Consultant</b></p>
  <li>The role of an SAP consultant is divided into 2 parts as Functional and Technical.</li>
  <li>Functional consultants are responsible for driving business meetings, preparing business case documents and communicating client requirements to the technical consultants. They also configure the SAP system to run as per the client’s requirements. I just mentioned about modules, they working in these field and they are called SD, PP consultant.</li>
  <li>Technical consultants are translate these documents(prepared by functional consultants) into technical documents and write code to implement their business needs.</li>
</ul>

<ul><p><b>5. SAP S/4 HANA Cloud</b></p>
  <li>S/4HANA is designed to solve complex problems and manage larger amounts of data. With SAP Fiori, it provides a better user experience and performs more complex operations on data.</li>
  <li>While deploying the SAP S/4HANA suite, we'll come across S/4HANA Cloud.</li>
  <li>SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a cloud ERP system that optimizes business processes with the help of intelligent automation and integrated technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Business Analytics.</li>
  <li>This enables us to achieve greater transparency, accessibility, agility, data accuracy and efficiency in our business.</li>
  <li>Shortly, it is a cloud system where SAP S4/HANA developments are deployments.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>This is how I listed the basic information we need to know about SAP basics. In time, we will make up for all our shortcomings together. Until then, see you.</p>
