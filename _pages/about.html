            In 2002, I started my education life at the <strong>Abdullah Bozbağ Elementary School</strong>, a small school located close to our home.
            Thanks to my interest in poetry and to write during my primary and secondary school years, I earned various provincial, district and school degrees. Apart from that, I was also interested in volleyball for a while.
            With a hardworking and ambitious student profile, I graduated from here with outstanding success.

            After completing my primary and secondary education, I started <strong>Atatürk Anatolian High School</strong> in 2010. In my early years, my passion for painting and music was at the forefront. Some guitar lessons
            I bought. Later, my passion for science took precedence over everything else. I became a researcher, curious, hardworking student. I have not yet decided what I want to do in my later life.
            but I was sure that I wanted to be in the scientific world. I graduated from high school with these thoughts.
