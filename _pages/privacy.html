<p class="txt-size-lead">Your privacy is just as important as you. This is for you to feel more secure while following my site. I work to know as little as possible about you and to ensure that the information you share remains confidential.</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 30px;">
  <li>I use Google Analytics so I can better understand who my website visitors are and where they come from.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 15px;">An estimated geographic information is added when using the contact form on my website. I use this predictive information to better understand who and where my contact person is. I keep this in strict security and utmost confidentiality with the information you provide in the contact form. You can choose not to use the contact form.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top: 30px;">I may update this privacy policy from time to time. If you have questions, suggestions or other feedback, please contact <strong>shrgurel@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
