<p>Hi everyone. I’m trying some experience in English lately. I really improved myself. But this is generally about speaking experience. I want to be student in abroad and I need to pass some exam especially TOEFL. I started study but it was very boring for me. And I thought “How can it be funny?”. I think, if we study together, we can do it better. Now, let’s follow my steps!
At first, I have a documentation that I prerared for you. I will share with you. It has some steps how can we start.
