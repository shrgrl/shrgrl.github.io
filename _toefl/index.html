<p>Hi everyone. I’m trying some experience in English lately. I really improved myself. But this is generally about speaking experience. I want to be student in abroad and I need to pass some exam especially TOEFL. I started study but it was very boring for me. And I thought “How can it be funny?”. I think, if we study together, we can do it better. Now, let’s follow my steps!
At first, I have a documentation that I prerared for you. I will share with you. It has some steps how can we start. 
</p>

<h4>PREPARING FOR TOEFL EXAM</h4>

<p>Toefl has 4 parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reading Part (30 point)</li>
  <li>Listening Part (30 point)</li>
  <li>Speaking Part (30 point)</li>
  <li>Writing Part (30 point)</li>
</ol>

<p>Totally 120 point.</p>

<p>If you want to detail information about these parts, you can look <a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/about" target="_blank">TOEFL’s formal web site.</a></p>

<p>And also, you have to take some documentation. There is a Official Guide to the TOEFL. You can take this from the internet but this book is not free. There is a really good 
  <a href="https://libgen.rs/" target="_blank">book database</a>. You can choose latest book.  If you want some other book, you can take from there. And second one, most important space is formal website. Because there has free exams and those are really useful. You can try yourself on there. </p>

<h4>STUDY PLAN ACCORDING TO THE BOOK</h4>
<ul>
  <li>First of all we will start READING part on the book. We will read texts and take all test. And like this, we will try our language experience. And also we will see how it is this exams question style.</li> 
  <li>Then we will pass second part what it is listening part. This book has listening training and audio files.</li>
  <li>My husband advice me about speaking and listening, don’t look this book. Because these are a little bit complex. So, we will look some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpi4cyj1hTscwo0XRDqlSsA" target="_blank">youtube channel.</a></li>
  <li>And we know, other people’s experience very important for us. I you can look other people experience or advice you can look this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/" target="_blank">reddit page.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My study plan and front preparing is like this. Now I’m starting!</p>

<p>First of all I will open book which it is I downloaded latest book.</p>

<h4>READING PART</h4>
<p>There are many types of questions in the reading section:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Factual Information Questions          : </b>This is about in the paragraph some real information. Probably, this question will start with “Acording to paragraph…”. You should read the paragraph and there will be a significant information in a sentence. You should do notice and find this answer.</li>
  <li><b>Negative Factual Information Questions : </b>This question type is similar with first one. As you can see from the title you should find the wrong option. The paragraph has some information and this question ask you wrong one. Be careful and find it. And don’t forget reading question. Because of I didn’t read thoroughly and tried find correct opinion.Therefor, I did a lot of mistake. Probably this question sentence will involve like “NOT, EXCEPT…” key words. </li>
  <li><b>Inference Questions                    : </b>In kind of this question, author tells us some information. But the author doesn't give detail. We need to find the desired answer from the implicit information given by the author.</li>
  <li><b>Rhetorical Purpose Questions           : </b>This is a similar type to the previous one. This question asks you to make an inference based on the implicit information provided by the author. Generally this question starts with “WHY…?”.</li>
  <li><b>Vocabulary Questions                   : </b>In this question, there is a short pasage and some vocabulary. This question asks us for the vocabulary that corresponds to the closest meaning of the vocabulary in the sentence.</li>
  <li><b>Reference Questions                    : </b>This question asks us reference something or someone. The paragraph says us some topic and someone or something in this topic and last it asks us “The word “ X ” in the passage refers to . . .”.</li>
  <li><b>Sentence Simplification Questions      : </b>In this question, there is a sentence in passage excerpt a sentence highlited. And question asks us, which sentence is same meaning with highlited sentence.</li>
  <li><b>Insert Text Questions                  : </b>In this type of question, you are given a new sentence and are asked where in the passage it would best fit.</li>
  <li><b>Prose Summary Questions                : </b>In this type of question, you should choose summary ideas in the passage.</li>
  <li><b>Fill in a Table Questions              : </b>In this kind of question, you will be given a partially completed table based on information in the passage. Your job is to complete the table by clicking on cor-rect answer choices and dragging them to their correct locations in the table.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will read all texts and take note the words I don’t know. Therefor, when I’m reading the PDF documantation, if I don’t know some word,  I’m using really good properties on Adobe Acrobat PDF. Firstly, I’m just reading the paragraph and taking note on page. Let me show you;</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/toefl/img2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/toefl/img2.jpg" alt="Toefl"></a><br>

<p>And when I read again, I can see word’s meaning easily. Besides, because of I do this, I can memorize easier.</p>
<p>By the way, I discovered a website: <a href="https://toefl.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary/decks" target="_blank">Magoosh</a>
This involve some exercise for vocabulary memorizing and TOEFL exam practice. Even speaking part. You can acord your voice and send them. After sending, they say you you’re good or bad.</p>
