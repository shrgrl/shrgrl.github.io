<p>Hello everyone. Here, I will give information about Epoch time and explain the Epoch Time Converter application. You can follow my Github account for source codes:</p>

<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">Technologies Used</h5>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<p>The duration in seconds from January 1, 1970 at 00:00 to any subsequent moment is called <b>Epoch Time</b>. (We need to take leap years into account in calculations, remember that 86400x365=31536000 seconds are consumed in each non-leap year and 86400x366=31622400 seconds in each leap year.)</p>

<p>The project consists of 3 parts. In the first (top) section of the application, there is a screen like the one below and each of the 3 information on this screen is updated every second and presented to the user.</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/epoch/img1.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/epoch/img1.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>In the second section of the application, there is a screen like the one below and when the Epoch time entered in the text box on this screen is clicked on the button next to it, it is converted to the time format we use and presented to the user.</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/epoch/img2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/epoch/img2.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>
  
<p>In the third and final section of the application, there is a screen similar to the one below and each HTML form element on this screen should be select. So the user can make each data entry thanks to a drop-down list. (The values to be listed for Year are between 1971 and 2023, for Month 01-January to 12-December, for Day 01 to 31, for Hour 01 to 23, for Minute 01 to 59 and for Second 01 to 59. On the other hand, Time Zone can be selected as Local or GMT. When the user enters data and clicks the button named Convert, the Epoch time corresponding to the relevant date is immediately reflected on the screen below.</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/epoch/img3.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/epoch/img3.jpg" alt=""></a><br/> 
  
<p>You can use the project directly by running the current html page.</p>
