<p>
  Hello everyone. This application offers users all the features that should be found in a news site with various web and mobile interface screens. You can follow my Github account for source codes:
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/shrgrl/newsWebSiteTemplate" target="_blank" class="btn btn-sasha-darkest"><i class="fab fa-github"></i>Click for details</a></p>

<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">Technologies Used</h5>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>The project consists of 2 versions as Web and mobile. When we click on the <i>index.html</i> file in the Web folder, you can see all the options we can see and access in the web interface of the project.</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/newsite/img1.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/newsite/img1.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>I created pages that define the mobile screen view and provided transition to the mobile version among the pages on the website (except for Current and Important Days). I added links to small images (The links I added change the page, but I did not create a new news page that covers the page, I just showed in the image that this feature works). I added 2 news videos (Current and Economy). Some pages have a button at the bottom that takes the page to the top. 
  The project also has slide feature in some tabs.</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/newsite/img2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/newsite/img2.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>The files in the sub_pages folder in the mobile folder of the project create the interfaces of the mobile version. Pages designed for mobile screen have the features in the web version. An extra member login screen has been added.</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/newsite/img3.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/newsite/img3.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>The project is briefly like this and you can see all interface designs on the project page. It is made only for design demonstration purposes of all the features that should be found in a news site, and when developed, a quite functional news site will emerge.</p>
