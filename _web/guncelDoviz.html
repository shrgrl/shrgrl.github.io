<p>Hello everyone. Here, we will see how to show current exchange rates and different information to users in API format. You can follow my Github account for source codes:</p>

</ul>

<p>This project is a <i>Current Exchange Rates Web Application</i>. It is written with Node.js/Express and we can run it on our local computer. The application sends a "get request" to <a href="https://api.canlidoviz.com/web/items?marketId=1&type=0" target="_blank" >this address</a> in the background for a "get request" coming to the root directory and parses the JSON String returned as a response. Then it sends an HTML page like the one shown in the figure as a response to the user.</p>

<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/gunceldoviz/img.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>

<p>When the user selects an exchange rate from the select list, information about the relevant rate is displayed on the right side of the screen. If the user wants, they can refresh the exchange rates thanks to a button located on the right side of the screen.</p>

<h5 class="txt-weight-bold">Running the Project</h5>
<p>To run the project, we need to open a command screen in the root directory where the project is located and write node ProjectName.js. Then we can use the application by typing the port address shown on the command screen into our web browser. The run command for this project is as follows:</p>
<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/gunceldoviz/img2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" data-max-height="1000"  data-max-width="1000">
<img class="img-blg" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/projects/gunceldoviz/img2.jpg" alt=""></a><br/>
